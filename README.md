bitcoindata
===========
This is an extensible toolset used to analyze the output of the [blockparser](https://github.com/mcdee/blockparser) CSV call.

Everything is currently under heavy development and is therefore likely to be broken. Within the next month I hope to have everything in stable working order.

Please contact me if you have any questions about its use, or if you want to help with its development.

We are using a machine with 22 GB of RAM, and some of these operations use all of it. Therefore, some of this code may be unrealistically slow on a typical personal computer.

This was written as part of a summer research project at Colgate University, with my advisor Vijay Ramachandran.
